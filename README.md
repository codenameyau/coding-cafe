**Forest Ecosystem** is a simulation based on this
[programming challenge](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/35322/30051).

I really enjoyed working on this project, and learned how to efficiently run a simulation
on a 3D Array data structure and then passing that data to be drawn in an HTML5 canvas.

I encountered several issues such as looping efficiency, splicing during loop iterations,
and designing an elegant ForestLife and ForestEcosystem interface. In the end it took several
paper brainstorms and redesigns, but ultimately turned out to be what I wanted!
